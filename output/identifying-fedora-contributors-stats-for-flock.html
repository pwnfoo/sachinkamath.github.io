        <p>Quoting the Fedora Wiki :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flock is an annual conference for Fedora contributors to come together, discuss new ideas, work to make those ideas a reality, and continue to promote the core values of the Fedora Community: Freedom, Friends, Features, and First.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was working on generating statistics for Flock this week. Bhagyashree (bee2502), my GSoC mentor,  had delivered a <a href="http://sched.co/76oD">talk</a> on Fedora Contributors and Newcomers Onboarding and I was assigned the task of generating statistics of the whole Fedora Community. At first thought, this was a pretty hectic thing to do. To accomplish this, I will need data of all the contributors from the beginning of fedmsg -i.e from 2012. And, I will have to find when a user had signed up for a FAS account and track his/her activity. <em>Phew!</em></p>
<p>Now let's crunch the numbers :</p>
<p><strong>Estimating Users :</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Fedora Badges Statistics" src="images/Screenshot-from-2016-08-08-18-49-45.png"></p>
<p>It was pretty simple, the Fedora Badges front-end (Tahrir) suggested that there were around 41,000 FAS Accounts which fedmsg was tracking and had logged into the badges website. I assumed that if an account was to be of a contributor, he/she should have logged into the badges system. Okay, so I have the count, what now?</p>
<p><strong>Making sense out of the mess :</strong></p>
<p>I fired up my tool and added an extra element to it, i.e : the topic field of the requests (as <code>org.fedoraproject.prod.fas.user.create</code>) and set the <code>--start</code> and <code>--end</code> to match the starting and ending date of every year.</p>
<p>In simple terms, I am pulling the usernames of all those people who made their FAS account in between the years 201<strong>x</strong> - 201<strong>(x+1)</strong> (from 2012 to 2016), one year at a time. This will give me the total count of FAS accounts made every year. I could have just taken the <code>count</code> value from the JSON for this, but I needed the usernames for later. Along with this, I also dumped the usernames into a file in the format <code>{username : timestamp_of_creation}</code> into a file.</p>
<p>It looked something like <a href="https://github.com/sachinkamath/fedora-flock/blob/master/dumps/2012.json">this</a>. I did this for all the years until I had <code>2012.json</code> to <code>2016.json</code>.</p>
<p>This gave me the count of FAS accounts being made every year - and with some pygal magic, I got this :</p>

<img alt="Yearwise FAS Accounts" src="images/new_fas_users_line.svg"></p>
<p><strong>Pull, pull, pull :</strong></p>
<p>Now that we have the usernames and the timestamp of creation, we can check if the user was active for a certain period or not. I did this by pulling the data of a user with the <code>--start</code> and the <code>--end</code> arguments in 3 different ways.</p>
<p>1) Check if the user was active immediately, for that - the <code>--start</code> was set as <strong><code>T1</code> = (time of account creation)</strong> and end was set as <strong><code>T2</code> = (time of account creation + timedelta of 2 weeks)</strong>.</p>
<p>If the user had <code>count &gt; 10</code>, then the user was checked if the user was active between <strong><code>T2</code></strong> and <strong><code>T2 + time delta of one month</code></strong>. If the user did not have any, a variable called <code>slow_start</code> was set to True for that user and was subsequently checked for 6+ months activity. Why? Because, there are a lot of people who created a FAS account early and started contributing after an year or so. Again, if <code>count</code> was less than 0, then the user was marked inactive.  If the user had activity during this period, he/she was marked as a slow starter. And this is what I got after running the script :</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/sachinkamath/95cdd1f5587d5581f25938ead5a8ceeb.js"></script>

<p><strong>Identifying long-term and short-term contributors :</strong></p>
<p>The following set of rules were set followed for differentiating users :</p>
<p><em>Users considered inactive :</em></p>
<p>1) Users who have less than 10 fedmsg activity count
2) Users who have only created FAS
3) Users who made very few wiki edits + created a FAS account
4) <code>not_category</code> was set as fedbadges for such messages - so that the fedmsg activity won't exceed 10.</p>
<p><em>Users considered short term :</em></p>
<p>1) Users who have activity &lt; 3 months.
2) People who have considerable amount of fedmsg activity and don't have any activity after a month.
3) <code>not_category</code> is again set as fedbadges here.</p>
<p><em>Users considered long term:</em></p>
<p>1) Users who have 3+ months of activity
2) Even if a user hasn't contributed in 6 months after creating the FAS account and then has considerable amount of fedmsg activity after another 6 months or an year.
3) Don't call it a comeback badge is considered https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/dont-call-it-a-comeback</p>
<p>After running this, I ended up with the following graph:</p>

<p>All this ended up in Flock in the form of a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ANub0RZtqnLaBDzpiQRUkZdnf7n75Pn9H16gb0wZg68/">presentation</a> and not to mention, had a good sleep after crunching up the stats :)</p>
